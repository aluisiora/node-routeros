# Discontinued

***I worked on this project in my spare time, but unfortunately I no longer work with mikrotik devices and don't have the free time anymore, so consider it as discontinued. Feel free to fork this project and create your own spin.***

# Description

This is a Mikrotik Routerboard API written in Typescript for nodejs, can be either used with plain javascript or imported on typescript projects.

This library will handle the API in a more lowerlevel way, for a simpler to use interface I recommend my [`routeros-client`](https://github.com/aluisiora/routeros-client) for a more "object-oriented" API, which wraps this API. It has a very rich documentation, so please check it out.

# Features

-   Connection and reconnection without destroying the object.
-   Change host, username and other parameters of the object without recreating it.
-   Based on promises.
-   You can choose to keep the connection alive if it gets idle.
-   Every command is async, but can be synced using the promises features.
-   Can pause, resume and stop streams (like what you get from /tool/torch).
-   Support languages with accents, keeping it consistent throughout winbox and api.

# Installing

```
npm install node-routeros --save
```

# Documentation

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/aluisiora/node-routeros/wiki) for a complete documentation.

# Examples

You can import in TypeScript using:

```typescript
import { RouterOSAPI } from 'node-routeros';
```

Adding an IP address to ether2, printing it, then removing it synchronously:

```javascript
const RosApi = require('node-routeros').RouterOSAPI;

const conn = new RosApi({
    host: '192.168.88.1',
    user: 'admin',
    password: '',
});

conn.connect()
    .then(() => {
        // Connection successful

        // Let's add an IP address to ether2
        conn.write('/ip/address/add', [
            '=interface=ether2',
            '=address=192.168.90.1',
        ])
            .then((data) => {
                console.log('192.168.90.1 added to ether2!', data);

                // Added the ip address, let's print it
                return conn.write('/ip/address/print', ['?.id=' + data[0].ret]);
            })
            .then((data) => {
                console.log('Printing address info: ', data);

                // We got the address added, let's clean it up
                return conn.write('/ip/address/remove', [
                    '=.id=' + data[0]['.id'],
                ]);
            })
            .then((data) => {
                console.log('192.168.90.1 as removed from ether2!', data);

                // The address was removed! We are done, let's close the connection
                conn.close();
            })
            .catch((err) => {
                // Oops, got an error
                console.log(err);
            });
    })
    .catch((err) => {
        // Got an error while trying to connect
        console.log(err);
    });
```

Listening data from /ip/torch and using pause/resume/stop feature:

```javascript
const RosApi = require("node-routeros").RouterOSAPI;

const conn = new RosApi({
    host: "192.168.88.1",
    user: "admin"
    password: ""
});

conn.connect().then(() => {
    // Counter to trigger pause/resume/stop
    let i = 0;

    // The stream function returns a Stream object which can be used to pause/resume/stop the stream
    const addressStream = conn.stream(['/tool/torch', '=interface=ether1'], (error, packet) => {
        // If there is any error, the stream stops immediately
        if (!error) {
            console.log(packet);

            // Increment the counter
            i++;

            // if the counter hits 30, we stop the stream
            if (i === 30) {

                // Stopping the stream will return a promise
                addressStream.stop().then(() => {
                    console.log('should stop');
                    // Once stopped, you can't start it again
                    conn.close();
                }).catch((err) => {
                    console.log(err);
                });

            } else if (i % 5 === 0) {

                // If the counter is multiple of 5, we will pause it
                addressStream.pause().then(() => {
                    console.log('should be paused');

                    // And after it is paused, we resume after 3 seconds
                    setTimeout(() => {
                        addressStream.resume().then(() => {
                            console.log('should resume');
                        }).catch((err) => {
                            console.log(err);
                        });
                    }, 3000);

                }).catch((err) => {
                    console.log(err);
                });

            }

        }else{
            console.log(error);
        }
    });

}).catch((err) => {
    // Got an error while trying to connect
    console.log(err);
});
```

# Cloning this repo

Note that, if are cloning this repo, you must be familiar with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) so you can make your changes.

## Testing

In order to run the tests, I used [RouterOS CHR](https://mikrotik.com/download) on a virtual machine with 4 interfaces, where the first interface is a bridge of my network card:

![VirtualBox RouterOS CHR Conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aluisiora/routeros-client/master/images/routeros-chr-interfaces.gif)

# TODO

-   Write more tests
